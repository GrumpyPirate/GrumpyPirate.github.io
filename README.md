## README

A very basic portfolio site, written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and built using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

### Key technologies used:

- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [react](https://reactjs.org/)
- [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)

### TODO

- [ ] Use contentful image resizer to thumbnail the huge webpage preview images
- [ ] Replace portfolio page item previews with dependency-free solution
- [ ] Sort/group portfolio items in some way, perhaps by creation date
- [ ] Code splitting via lazy-loading components with @loadable/component
- [ ] Migrate completely over to Babel 7 (including deprecating babel-polyfill)
- [ ] Tidy up ContentService, deprecate use of `lodash.get`
