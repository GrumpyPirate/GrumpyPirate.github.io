Personal portfolio website, written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and built using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

### Key technologies used:

- [ ] Switch tests over to `@testing-library/react`
- [ ] Use contentful image resizer to thumbnail the huge webpage preview images
- [ ] Replace portfolio page item previews with dependency-free solution
- [ ] Sort/group portfolio items in some way, perhaps by creation date
- [ ] Code splitting via lazy-loading components with @loadable/component
- [ ] Migrate completely over to Babel 7 (including deprecating babel-polyfill)
